# Build a Time Series Forecast Model for Inventory Management

I am not that habituated using R notebooks , so have tried to explain the stuff in a presentation along with eda

The process which i followed was 
  1) Data transformation 
  2) Exploratory data analysis
  3) Hyperparameter tuning 
  4) Cross validation 
  5) Choosing the best model
  6) Predicting using the best model

The output of the model(cv_all,coeff_all,forecast) are more than 25 MB in size, i have asked Komal for a place to send those files.
