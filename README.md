# Build a Time Series Forecast Model for Inventory Management

I am not that habituated using R notebooks , so have tried to explain the stuff in a presentation along with eda

The process which i followed was 
  1) Data transformation 
  2) Exploratory data analysis
  3) Hyperparameter tuning 
  4) Cross validation 
  5) Choosing the best model
  6) Predicting using the best model
